<p>&emsp;PHP: Hypertext Processor (Or just PHP) is a general-purpose programming language designed for web development. 
    PHP has been around since 1994 and originally PHP stood for Personal Home Page and didn't have a formal specification or standard until 2014. 
Early PHP was not intended as a new programming language but grew organically.
There have been many versions over the years, leading to PHP 7 today, with each version significantly adding to the power and capabilities of PHP.
