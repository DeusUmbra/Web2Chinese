    <p>&emsp; This script uses two different functions to see which names among the different Chinese Zodiac Names are the most
        similar. One function checks based on how few letters would need to be changed, while the other checks 
        based on how few letters would need to be removed or added. So while the two functions are similiar, they perform their task
        in different ways.

<div> <a id="char"><h3>Character Functions</h3></a>
    <p>&emsp; This script counts the number of times each letter appears in a string and compares that count to the number 
        of times each letter appears in the names of the Chinese zodiac signs to determine if the name can be 
        made from the characters in the string.
