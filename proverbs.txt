If a son is uneducated, his father is to blame.
A book is like a garden carried in the pocket.
Clear conscience never fears midnight knocking.
A smile will gain you 10 more years of life.
Patience is a bitter plant, but its fruit is sweet.
A fall into a ditch makes you wiser.
Bad things never walk alone.
Age and time do not wait for people.
An ant may well destroy a whole dam.
Thanks Barry!
